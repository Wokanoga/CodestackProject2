Waluigi is now in Nintendo.  It was his destiny all along to confront Sakurai, and he feels inexorably drawn into the depths of Nintendo.  Until finally Waluigi comes before a giant door.  On the door are the letters, MS.
Waluigi pushes the doors open.  He is born witness to a massive warehouse looking room.  Aisles line the room, stocked full with figurines of could be but never implemented Nintendo Characters.
At the end of the room is a simple desk with a man sitting at it.  The man is ruffling through a paper document with his left hand, and writing something onto a piece of paper with his right hand.
The man looks up.  
"Hello Waluigi. I've been expecting you."
He puts the documents down and lays his pen in the center of his desk.  He stands up.
"I made a great mistake once.  I let you loose upon the world.  I have been doing everything I can to undo what I have done.  And at last you have arrived.  Time to delete you from existence."
"WAAAHHHH"
"So be it."
