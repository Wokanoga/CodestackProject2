1 Events leading into Aborto eating his own family, being conscious of the situation post eating.

2 Gregory makes moves to gain his families trust or to get them to realise it's him, he doesn't succeed in either and Amélie kills him.  Alice then realizes the identity of the zombie after inspecting the corpse.  Family is distrought.

3 Gregory fails to defend his family from the zombie horde.  Amélie and Alice are devoured alive while he's helpless to stop the horde.
