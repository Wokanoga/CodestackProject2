Aborto's Endeavor

A story of the struggle and difficult choices of Aborto the Zombie.

Aborto has killed a total of 18 men with his bare bearclaws.

Aborto Family: A wife named Amelie, and a daughter named Alice.

Story thoughts:

Most tragic ending should be some event leading into Aborto eating his own family, being conscious of the situation post eating.

Another tragic ending possibility.  Aborto makes moves to gain his families trust or to get them to realise it's him, he
doesn't succeed in either and Amelie kills him.  Alice then realizes the identity of the zombie after inspecting the
corpse.  Family is distrought.

Mild ending.
